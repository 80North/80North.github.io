### Full Disclosure

I have been a avid player of Animal Crossing games for the existence of most of the series. I own both New Leaf and Wild World, and have put in over 700 hours between the two. This series is one that I have enjoyed and may be sentimental about in some fashion.

I am strongly against any form of in-game transactions, even in the case of this game being free for download, I do not have any intentions of making any kind of purchase. I buy games up front, I do not pre-order, and I don't spend in game. If it is a free game I won't be paying into it.

### Introductions to the game

Animal Crossing is a long standing open world sandbox game, having started in 2002 as claimed by Nintendo themselves.[1](#ref1) From release then until now, Nintendo claiming the numbers accurate "As of September 30, 2017" Animal Crossing: Wild World is disclosed as having shifted 11.75 million copies.[2](#ref2) As for the newer edition of the game, New Leaf comes in slightly lower with 11.23 million sold.[3](#ref3) Apple's App store does not disclose download statistics, but Google Play gives a range for installs. For the sake of simplicity we will be doubling the statistic we have, bringing our 5-10 range to 10-20 million app installs.[4](#ref4) The short of it is this may be the largest release of the franchise to the world to date.

The games themselves all share many of the same mechanics. The world you play in for the main series has been an open sandbox, where in the town area you can transform landscape in a limited fashion by planting trees or flowers. It was in this area the player primarily made money in the game. Mechanics such as fishing, bug catching, along with collecting objects such as fruit in the world would be gathered and then could be sold for the game currency "Bells." Your new found riches are then available to be quickly spent on house upgrades, along with new furniture, and clothes for your character. Fashion and appearance in the game, along with interaction and maintenance of your town, are the only goals in the game.

With player designed goals, and grind based money creation, the games were created to be a experience you create for yourself. The money aspects of the game, and the process to get there through gathering materials, can be a sticking point for people. Called a grind or a chore of a game by some, I will agree that it is time consuming, but regardless I enjoyed the game for the simplicity and ability to tailor the world to my own tastes.

### The new and different

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp's world makes some changes from this previous map style and world structure. Instead of an open style world, we have a number of Islands and limited map locations. These small zones each are centered around a type of resource gathering, such as a beach for fishing, or a forest clearing for fruit trees. The zones are not connected, instead traversed to through traveling using the players RV, or in reality watching a load screen for a short duration. As well as the more limited world, your changes to the areas are also pared down, being able to change only defined areas of your camp site and your player owned RV. 

The process of making money has changed as well along with world. In Pocket Camp we now have an abstraction of currency into two types, premium leaf tickets, and Bells. Leaf tickets are earned in small quantity through leveling up, and some of the achievements in the game which are referred to as stretch goals, as well as being up for purchase for real money. Bells, in a twist, are now gathered through gathering materials requested by animals in the game, where one resides in each zone, and you can have up to eight at your campsite. Through giving them collectable materials, you get crafting materials and bells.

Much like the older games, there is a market area where you can make purchases of clothing and furniture using bells. Unlike previous there is now a crafting system in place that allows you to use crafting materials such as wool and steel, as well as a heap of bells and being forced to wait real world time. Under this area there is also a crafting tab for clothing, with a message indicating that it will be coming later.

Relationships in the game have also been overhauled. The player's ability to get their favorite animals portrait still exists, and the system to get there is more transparent. Relationships, and the heart points to progress them, are earned through chatting and providing requested resources to them.

You the player can level up now as well, bringing a gating mechanic to the crafting system. Through leveling up the animals relationships you gain points to level yourself, and unlock more crafting as well as getting a tidy sum of bells and the introduction of new animals that you have unlocked.

### In-Game Transactions & Dark Patterns

I do not discuss purchasing game currency as Micro-Transactions. I prefer In-Game Purchases in terminology, and I refer to the changing of game mechanics to encourage purchases as dark patterns.

Like many of the mobile games out there, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp has been designed to gear game mechanics around getting players to make a purchase. From the time I have been playing I've had a few experiences in the game that have left me thinking that they exist purely to get the player to pay money. From the gathering to the animal dialog to the player home RV, there are many designed put in place to wear the player down.

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/Posts/Animal-Crossing-Pocket/2.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The first, and most invasive, is the net, honey, and fertilizer system put in place in each zone. Instead of the normal game systems of gathering materials, each island has a small number of the bugs or fish available, and you must make a few visits back and forth to gather a decent number of supplies. In place of that, the player can pay leaf tickets to skip this and in one swoop gather a large amount of bugs, fish, or fruit without any wait.

Another egregious addition would be the dialog in game and on load screens about this content. I have frequently been handing in a request by one of the animals in game, or talking to them for heart points and had them talk about these paid for options being easy, quick, cheap, whatever they want to say in marketing these mechanic cutting pathways. As well, these statements along with pictures appear on loading screens, assaulting you to make a purchase while you wait to continue playing.

One of the final issues here on attempting to pilfer from your wallet, would be in the RV upgrades. It's such a small change that threw me when I discovered it. When you choose to upgrade there is very, very little indication on price or payments to be made. It is only after the fact, that you are burdened with a mortgage that must be repaid. Especially after looking up some of the numbers, these payments seem very steep for the amount of bells that you slowly earn if you're not paying to progress.

### My Thoughts and Opinion

Ever a fan of the series, I want to like this game. I have always enjoyed the Animal Crossing experience and the ability to have control over your world. This is exactly what a mobile phone version of the game I expected, in-game transactions and low computing power sized zones are to be expected.

I do not see this as a long term game, I will eventually grow tired of the nagging to spend money. But until that day comes about I have a campsite and a camper to make all my own.

### TL;DR

Animal Crossing, the Nintendo Series from 2002 has created a mobile app version of their popular DS and console title. The game makes changes from the previous versions such as a number of smaller material gathering zones, a crafting system for cloths and furniture, and a new leveling system. The game also is the first to introduce in-game transactions to milk the player for money to more easily gather materials to progress. These paid options are constantly reminded to the player and deeply woven into the various areas of the game. As such I do not see this game as being an enjoyable long term experience, but will be playing in the hopes that through updates it becomes a more flushed out and tolerable.

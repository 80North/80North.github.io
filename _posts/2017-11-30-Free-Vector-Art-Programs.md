### Vector Art?

In the world of graphics there are two kinds, Raster and Vector. Photos we take, JPEGs on the internet, are Raster. It's a collection of pixels that together make up an image. On the other end, with Vector, the images are made up of formulas that generate the image using associations between various parts. Sounds confusing, but here is another, more simple idea in differentiation. Raster Images become pixelated when zoomed, Vector images do not pixilate and remain sharp.

Vector images are usually smaller as well, as there is a number of formulas to remember, instead of information on every single pixel in the image. This makes Vector formats such as SVG a great option in making a website perform faster. Despite this rule of thumb, not all images are smaller in Vector. More simple graphics are good in vector, more complex photos are usually better in Raster formats such as JPEG and PNG.

Vector images are used in various areas, such as in websites for logos, as well as backgrounds and decals. Outside of just images, vectors are used in other places as well. Often a website is designed and laid out in a Vector format before it is then created, in order to preview the design and easily then move elements around. PDF files are another example, where the pages can be laid out in Vector software and then imported in a Vector format, again for the ability to scale as well as for the smaller file size in some cases.

### What's out there?

I've been using Inkscape for the longest time, unaware of what else was out there. Only recently on Hacker News did I see this come up and then look for more options. Looking on Product Hunt I found a number of options as well. From what was available I did find some other alternatives, but nothing comes close to contesting the depth of features that Inkscape offers.

#### Inkscape

Probably the most well known option, I've already had to mention it in the initial write-up. The interface is usable, following some of the standards set by the industry leader, Adobe's Illustrator. The tools that are available are expansive, with rarely a case where a tool in Illustrator doesn't have a counterpart or tool that can in some form replace it. The largest sore point for me is the lack of tools that make repetition quick. Overlooking this, the interface can be skinned to look however you want, and there are some great looking dark themes out there. I've been using Inkscape for the past 18 months and have enjoyed it as I have grown more accustomed to the hotkeys and layout.

#### SVG-Edit

I'll admit that I wrote this off initially when I saw it. Web based tools have never ranked high on my mental list of great features. Usually this means it's a very stripped down and powerless tool that performs only the very most basic of functions. This is not the case here, I saw the full interface online, and was somewhat surprised. You have a number of tool options, a full color picker, web search for shapes, and more. The high precision and smooth curves from the pencil tool also caught my attention. It doesn't rival Inkscape, but the options here are good if your needing to make a quick edit from another computer or are doing simple adjustments. It's a web app, so no installations which is nice for a quick and infrequent usage pattern. I won't be using it, but for sure there is potential in a web based workflow or on machines you can't make installs on.

#### Bez

This can be looked at as the honorable mention here, I don't have any way to run this tool. Bez is a editor for Apple devices, such as the Ipad, which is more the focus they mention and is how it is shown in screenshots. From looking at the videos that they present, the interface appears to be very nice, sporting a clean dark theme and having context menus that appear based on the editing that you are conducting. If I had an Apple device this would be right on my list of apps.

#### VPaint

Normally I shy away from including products that have been abandoned and their developer has then moved to making a paid option of the software. It's not a good look for the future of your workflow. In this case, I have added it as it has some editing options for making vector art, as well as some basic animation workflow here as well. I won't use this dead software, but I wanted to mention it for the unique feature it offers on top of the normal workspace.

#### Vecteezy

Another editor in the web only line up, this editor competes with SVG-Edit. In the interface Vecteezy wins out, it is clean, and looks much better. The tabbed interface is more task oriented and can speed up work on individual tasks. Unfortunately, this editor comes with the downside that you must have an account in order to use it and save your work. This is a big issue for me, I strongly dislike any service that has a focus on gathering user data and locking off parts or all of the software wholesale if you don't participate. I don't want your mailing list, I don't want an account. Given the limited scope and the shortage of tools, SVG-Edit takes a strong position against this software. The only advantage Vecteezy has in my eyes is the interface, which is not enough to get me to give up my privacy and usage habit for.

#### Vectr

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/Posts/Vector/Vectr.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The final mention on my list, Vectr is a unique option for your graphics workflow. The interface of Vectr is the best of the bunch in my eyes, nice dark skin with a slick button and icon design. It offers both a downloadable client as well as being a web app. The tools are decent, but as with everything, Inkscape is far ahead and Illustrator is the gold standard.  But on the flip side, Vectr requires an account, a Dark Pattern I despise. As well the desktop app is built using Electron which is an issue for people. Electron is very memory heavy and slow and gives this attribute to anything built using it. Despite the mentioned downsides, Vectr is the best Inkscape alternative or addition I could find, with a great interface, is on every platform including web, and most feature rich I could find.

### TL;DR

Inkscape and vector editors are great software for development of art that scales as well as interface and web design. There are many options out there for free and paid options. Of what is free, I like and use Inkscape and SVG-Edit. Vectr makes a strong case for replacing my use of SVG-Edit, but I won't be signing up for an account. Also on the list of usable is Vecteezy and Bez depending on your platform. If you're in a pinch and looking for something a bit different VPaint may be useful, but is dead software. For anything serious Inkscape seems to be the only real option out there for OSS replacement of Adobe's Illustrator.

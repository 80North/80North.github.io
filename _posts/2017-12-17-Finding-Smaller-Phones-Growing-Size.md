### Disclosure

This page provides links to the sales front of Amazon for each product listed. These links are affiliate links through Amazon, and thus purchases made after using them support the continued creation of content for this blog. You can just as easily open Amazon and search for the name of the device to find it without providing any support to 80North.

I am an Android phone user currently, and wish to continue to use that platform over Apple. I am not happy with the state of Google spying on Android, and I recognize the quality of Apple's ecosystem. But regardless, I use Android and prefer it.

### Your phone is so large it is disgusting

The first smart device I owned was a 4 inch IPod generation 2  [[1](#1)]. I've had many other phones and devices, with the most recent two being the HTC M8, and the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3. The HTC was 5 inches  [[2](#2)]. The Idol 3 is 5.5 inches  [[3](#3)]  for the screen size. Our phones are continuing to grow in size.

The new IPhone plus is also 5.5 inches  [[4](#4)], a premium phone that is targeted at the majority of the market is part of this huge screen movement. The second contender for phones that meets the other largest segment of the market, the Samsung galaxy S phone line, comes with a whopping 6.2 inch screen [[5](#5)]! These sizes are crazy, considering the size of an IPhone just 5 years ago in 2012 were sporting 4 inch screens [[6](#6)].

<a name="why"></a>
### But why has this happened?

There are two reasons that I can point to, of more that I would imagine exist, as to why our phones are growing. One has to do with the phone's use case. The other has to do with the physical components that are being used in the construction.

With the growth of the mobile web to support the large fleet of phones that people are now carrying, you can watch videos on the go, read books, edit spreadsheets in mobile office, shop from hundreds of retailers, and browse the web. All of these options are great that they exist for a phone, but can be quite cumbersome due to the small screens that our phones have. People want a larger screen on their phone to be able to more easily do all of these various activities where and when ever they want.

The second force that has been driving this is the IPS panels that are used for the screen on a phone. For higher resolutions, the panel size increases and thus the total size of the phone screen. We are packing the pixels pretty tight as it is, the hardware just in not getting smaller as fast as the demand for 1080p panels and larger has surged. To get a phone with these higher resolutions the screen has to be larger, it is a tradeoff that must be made.

### What is out there for smaller phones?

The options are slim pickings for a modern small phone that has a screen under 5 inches. There exists many older phones that meet the criteria, but we are looking for a phone that provides fully modern hardware from the last two years.


### [IPhone SE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071W3DDM7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B071W3DDM7&linkCode=as2&tag=80north-20&linkId=528600033b39872d90f3d239d328ef43)

Apple has a phone for every segment of the market it seems. Large phones, expensive phones, and in the case of the IPhone SE a smaller and cheaper option. The phone has a familiar form factor similar to that of the IPhone 5, coming in at 4 inches in size [[7](#7)] with a $350 price tag attached, but I have found it to be around $295 at the time of writing.

### [Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074P5FMGC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=80north-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074P5FMGC&linkId=ef101a9e27a1ae0ba53bd6b6492c4aaa)

Sony is the only other company out there that seemed to be focused on making a smaller form factor phone for the longest time. The ZX1 is a improvement on the previous X compact phone, taking the previous mid tier offer and making a more premium contender with hardware that even beats that of the aforementioned IPhone. The screen comes in at 4.6 inches, and is priced higher at $540 [[8](#8)]. ([Check the price now](https://camelcamelcamel.com/Sony-Xperia-XZ1-Compact-Unlocked/product/B074P5FMGC))


### [Sony Xperia X Compact](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LACBMV2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=80north-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01LACBMV2&linkId=f733a1d59dfa2c65dc872de397954406)

As mentioned the X Compact of last year was aimed at being a more middle tier phone. The price point on this model originally put it above Apple at a high $500 for 4.6 inches [[9](#9)] of phone screen real estate. Over the last few months I has seen the prices for this model dip as far down as $265 on amazon, making this a strong option for a sleek phone at a optimal price.

### Honorable Mention: [Samsung Galaxy A3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XH73MKR/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=80north-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XH73MKR&linkId=87ab075e80fb5887e4424dba85f530f7)

I questioned if I should mention this phone here, but decided to make some mention of it. The A3 seems a strong contender that is new to the landscape from Samsung, with a 4.7 inch screen [[10](#10)] and claimed to be a primarily metal bodied phone that resembles that of the main line Galaxy S phones. I was unable to find any first party sales on amazon of the phone and instead only located pages where 3rd parties where distributing the device. Poor availability makes the phone a hold out for the above contenders. ([Check the price now](https://camelcamelcamel.com/Samsung-DS-Unlocked-International-Warranty/product/B06XH73MKR))

### TL;DR

Phones are continuing to get larger due to user desire and screen hardware constraints. I desire a phone that is under 5 inches in size, and thus have been looking around to find modern options for a small profile device. If your an Apple fan you have the [IPhone SE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071W3DDM7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B071W3DDM7&linkCode=as2&tag=80north-20&linkId=528600033b39872d90f3d239d328ef43). If your into Android instead you have options from Sony in the Xperia compact line [X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LACBMV2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=80north-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01LACBMV2&linkId=f733a1d59dfa2c65dc872de397954406) or the more recent [XZ1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074P5FMGC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=80north-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074P5FMGC&linkId=ef101a9e27a1ae0ba53bd6b6492c4aaa) , as well Sumsung has an offering in the [A3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XH73MKR/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=80north-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XH73MKR&linkId=87ab075e80fb5887e4424dba85f530f7) but it seems to be hard to find. Of the hundreds of phones out there now, only a small handful of modern manufacturers are maintaining a lineup for under 5 inch devices.

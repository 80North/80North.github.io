### Learn About the Blog
<div class="box">
  <p>
  I've written on a number of other small blogs, hosted on platforms like Wordpress and Wix, and I wasn't happy with the level of control that I had. Ever the open source fanatic, I wanted something running on hardware under my control. Thus Jekyll and Git became the backbone of choice after I read about them used in this fashion on HN. It was some time mid 2017 where I fell for Markdown, as a minimal and fast way to style and produce a quick formated block of text. It's about that simple, initially in high-school it was a group effort, now its solo with a nice stack of open software using Markdown.

### Learn About the Writer

  <p>
  I'll start of by saying I am a millennial, but I would claim I have a pleasant mixture of both old-fashioned style as well as new. I was a right-winger in my politics, from the household I grew up in. Now I would say I am much more centric, but I do not identify with any party. I have left and right leaning opinions, depending on what the subject matter is. My political view is fairly understated, as politics are not allowed at work. My work life consists of conducting public relations for a medium-sized governmental agency. I my work, and it has bled over into my personal hobbies as a writer and a photographer. Professionalism and top-tier quality are my end goals to everything I do and will be paramount in my content that resides here.
